// The Stream class
// ================

// Stream is a [Duplex stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_duplex)
// subclass that implements the [HTTP/2 Stream](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-5)
// concept. It has two 'sides': one that is used by the user to send/receive data (the `stream`
// object itself) and one that is used by a Connection to read/write frames to/from the other peer
// (`stream.upstream`).

export { Stream };

// Public API
// ----------

// * **new Stream(log, connection)**: create a new Stream
//
// * **Event: 'headers' (headers)**: signals incoming headers
//
// * **Event: 'promise' (stream, headers)**: signals an incoming push promise
//
// * **Event: 'priority' (priority)**: signals a priority change. `priority` is a number between 0
//     (highest priority) and 2^31-1 (lowest priority). Default value is 2^30.
//
// * **Event: 'error' (type)**: signals an error
//
// * **headers(headers)**: send headers
//
// * **promise(headers): Stream**: promise a stream
//
// * **priority(priority)**: set the priority of the stream. Priority can be changed by the peer
//   too, but once it is set locally, it can not be changed remotely.
//
// * **reset(error)**: reset the stream with an error code
//
// * **upstream**: a [Flow](flow.js) that is used by the parent connection to write/read frames
//   that are to be sent/arrived to/from the peer and are related to this stream.
//
// Headers are always in the [regular node.js header format][1].
// [1]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_message_headers
